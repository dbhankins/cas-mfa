For more information [visit](https://unicon.net/opensource/cas).\r\n\r\nThis is a project to develop free and open source compatibly licensed extensions for the CAS server `v3.6.x` product implementing\r\n\r\n* support for authenticating using multiple authentication factors\r\n* support for relying parties (CAS-using applications) understanding how strongly the user authenticated from the ticket validation response, and\r\n* support for relying parties exerting authentication strength requirements.\r\n\r\nThe intention is to develop a solution that can be adopted by current CAS adopters.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n* JDK 7~8\r\n* Maven 3\r\n* Tomcat 7~8\r\n\r\n## MultiFactor Support\r\n* `duo-two-factor` (via DuoSecurity)\r\n* `yubikey-two-factor` (via YubiKey)\r\n* `toopher-two-factor` (via Toopher)\r\n* `authy-two-factor` (via Authy)\r\n* `radius-two-factor` (via RADIUS OTP)\r\n* `strong-two-factor` (Custom)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nPlease review [the project wiki](https://github.com/Unicon/cas-mfa/wiki) for additional information on scope, functionality and how-to walkthroughs.\r\n\r\n## Build Status\r\n* [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Unicon/cas-mfa.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Unicon/cas-mfa)\r\n* [ ![Codeship Status for Unicon/cas-mfa](https://www.codeship.io/projects/0bbd72d0-b74c-0130-d193-1eff452fc99e/status?branch=master)](https://www.codeship.io/projects/4315)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
